About a decade ago I was making plans to move to Norway for a year. I had never been there before and I was researching the country and even learning as much Norwegian in my spare time. 

When I arrived I realized there's a lot that you can know in theory or about something but to actually experience it, is an entirely different level of understanding.

As I stumbled through my few Norwegian words, I quickly realized that the phrases I was using were irrelevant to the modern slang; almost too proper. 

During my year there, I did pick up a bit more and as I learned sometimes I would come across a word that brought deeper meaning to the familiar English words I grew up with. 

I also felt like it opened my mind to understand different concepts that we don't even have words for in English. 

I find that learning a programming language is no different. Even after you understand the programming fundamentals which makes learning more programming languages even easier. Only once you get into the language and actually start using it, do you understand what it is. It expands your mind to process data in more ways. 

Right now I am working on three projects that all use different languages (Ruby, Python and Javascript) and it's fun to discover the advantages of all of them. In some cases knowing something is possible in one language, makes you wonder if it's possible to do that in another languages and so you try and then you learn it's possibilities.

It in the experience that we grow.
