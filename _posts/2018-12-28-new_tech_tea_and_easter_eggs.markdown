A new techy appliance was added to our household over the holidays. My husband and I love tech and we plan to build a smart house one day. We talk about the things we would like our house to do for us and even the applications that go along with that. We actually often talk about various programs and applications and what they can do, how we could create them and why hasn't it been done already. While there are a lot of programs out there, lots of them are dated and lack modern finesse. Likewise, about a year ago when it came to finding a new electric kettle I was looking for some modern finesse.

If you know me then you know my standards are pretty high when it comes to anything tea related. I can say with confidence that I make a better cup of tea than anyone I personally know. I have done extensive research on the matter and I even started collecting data about tea varieties and different cultivars. Eventually I tuned that sheet into a mobile app using AppSheet which is a Google Sheet add on which displays the sheet data in an basic CRUD app and then syncs it back to the sheet when changes are made. You can also customize the UX and even white list it with a paid subscription but you can use it and even add it to your mobile devise with the free version.

During my tea journey, I have seen a lot of kettles. I'm actually on my fourth electric kettle now and each one has improved as I have grown in my tea journey. The first being nothing special, a pot that boils water. But then I found out that you should have different temperatures for different teas. This is one of the most crucial details about making tea as you can burn the leaves and the tea will become bitter. Even if you're not a geek about tea, this is worth knowing. 

```
def brew_tea
   if (tea == green && temp > 170)
      puts "Yuck, you burned the tea"
   else 
      puts " You have made a delicious cup of tea"
   end
end
```

**Tea Type	          Temp                   Brewing Time**
Green Tea:	       170-175º          1-2 min.
Oolong Tea:	     175-185º	          2-3 min.
Black Tea:	        200=205º	        2-3 min.

Ergo the second kettle was variable temperature which means you can set the temperature and it will turn off when that temperature is reached. Something you should know is that the cheaper the kettle, the more the temp can be off by even 10 degrees as the water will continue to heat even when turned off. 


But Then Gong Fu... This method of steeping tea that is practiced in the eastern part of the world and it yields a superior cup of tea every time. Simple instructions, you use a higher ratio of tea to water and steep it for a very short time. The pouring needs to be precise as you often you use a very small pot (100ml-150ml).

Ergo the third kettle… the gooseneck, though by this time I was researching kettles extensively and read about a smart kettle in the UK. I couldn't find a smart kettle to meet my standard in the US yet. To make do, I got a gooseneck kettle which wasn't variable temperature but I bought a thermometer to stick in the top and I found that to be more precise then it predecessor who was a variable temperature but not very accurate.

Along the wait, I read about a new company (Fellow) who was launching with a smart kettle. 
• A gooseneck
• Variable temperature
• Smart kettle
One kettle to rule them all... It is counter balanced, heats within one degree and can be temperature adjusted, turned on and off from a mobile device. When it arrived, I even discovered it had a hidden eater egg in the software. 

*"There’s an Easter egg in Stagg EKG’s software. You have 2 hints to find it: 
• The hen must leave the nest. 
• One must travel across the farm and back to trigger the egg"*

What is the Easter Egg? A little game called "Wormy". It displays on the 1inch screen on the base and can be played using the temperature turn knob.

This little kettle is everything this programmer has dreamed of and an Easter Egg to top it all.
