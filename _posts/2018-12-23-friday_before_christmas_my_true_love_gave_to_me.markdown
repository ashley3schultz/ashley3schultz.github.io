## The only Wi-Fi connection...

We've all experienced it, that moment when you are living life like a normal person and suddenly you have no internet.
This time it was the Friday before Christmas and half the city lost their internet during a 7 hour outage.

Now a moment of silence for retailers everywhere... 

On a side note, I actually grew up off the grid in the mountains of Montana without electricity or internet. That being said, I have become very fond of every tech amenity there is to offer and I have no plans of returning to my rustic roots. As a souvenir, I could out survive anyone in a zombie apocalypse; however you won't find me camping by choice.

So, back to the part where half the city returned to the dark ages... I'm at work getting ready to leave soon and suddenly an internet outage... only today was an exception as I had two interviews scheduled (via web conference) and the first one starting in one hour. I knew I could use my phone as a backup plan (Smart Phone, May it live forever); however I wanted to be prepared for wherever the interview went.

I quickly ran home to check if the internet was also down at my house, and indeed it was and what along with every charter user in the city which in a smaller town like ours, that's quite a lot.

Thankfully I had a few minutes to improvise and find a new location. I'm not one to just give up. 
I immediately had several thoughts coming to mind, including a friend's house, coffee house or another business that has Wi-Fi. 

I called my husband who works pretty close by and thankfully they still had an internet connection. So I packed up my laptop and notes and in just a few minutes he had me on the network and in a private conference room at that and I still had about 20 minutes to spare which after all the last minute rushing around, I really needed to catch my breath. 

My hubby really came through and special thanks to his workplace for being so accommodating. 

Tell Santa "all I want for Christmas is a WI-FI connection!"
