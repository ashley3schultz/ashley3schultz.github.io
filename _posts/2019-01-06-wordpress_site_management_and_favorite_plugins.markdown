Along my freelance work I have collected several WordPress sites that I manage for other companies. This typically mean creating new posts, adding events, and adding features and the occasional overhaul. 

This weekend I have another little project for one of my clients which includes added a feature to their site that allows them to have members signup at different tiers and then be able to access all that data. 

I find it more natural to build something from scratch. I can already see the database in my mind but more often the client needs something integrated which in this case means figuring out which plugin is best for their specific needs and will it work with their other plugins and theme as there's always a chance that they will not get along very well. 

Along all my websites, I have found a few plugins to be faithful and I have used them on several of my client's sites. 
These plugins are amongst my favorites. 

**Posite**
*Create posts via email. Significantly upgrades the Post by Email features of WordPress*
I have mentioned this little plugin before and for good reason. This little guy allows you to create a post by sending an email. It's that simple and 

**Content View** 
*Query and display posts, pages in awesome layouts (grid, scrollable list, collapsible list) easier than ever, without coding!*
For some content view, this is a great little plugin and pretty versatile when it comes to displaying any type of content.

**Simple Calendar**
*Add Google Calendar events to your WordPress site in minutes. Beautiful calendar displays. Fully responsive.*
This has multiple views and the great part is that it grabs events from one or multiple Google calendars. 

**NextScripts: Social Networks Auto-Poster**
*This plugin automatically publishes posts from your blog to your social media accounts on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+ and 25 more networks.*

**Any Mobile Theme Switcher**
*This plugin allow you to detect all mobile platform and switch the theme. Supports most of the mobile platform including iphone, ipad, ipod, windows mobile, parm os, blackberry, android, andriod tab.*
If you have some a theme that is not responsive, find another, or if that's not an option, this you can use a separate theme for mobile. 

**Equivalent Mobile Redirect**
*Detect and redirect mobile visitors to the equivalent page on your mobile site.*
If for some reason you need to display a different page for mobile devices, then this can redirect to another page. 

**Caldera Forms**
*Easy to use, grid based responsive form builder for creating simple to complex forms.*
Just a simple form plugin, but it's pretty smart and can be customized nicely. It does calculations which is great for a nerd like me. 

**Drivr Lite - Google Drive Plugin**
*Drivr helps you to access files from your Google Drive Account quickly and seamlessly.*
For storage issues, you can store media files on Google drive instead of WordPress. One of the things I love about this, I can catalog images and when using Postie, you can email posts using links. I have tied a lot of these together with the Google scripts that I have previously posted.
