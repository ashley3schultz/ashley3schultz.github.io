I have always been a student at heart. I don’t like just knowing information but I enjoy understanding it and I enjoy the process to understanding. 

**I am a student of tea…**

I had no original agenda to become so knowledgeable about tea, it was really my passion that made a way for me. I wanted to know more about tea so I began a journey.

You are probably wondering what tea has to do with coding…  Well both tea and coding are a life long journey for me.

**I am a student of tea and code…**
I don’t ever want to be done learning about either!

My coding journey all began with Microsoft Excel… At first it was a simple need to organize and manage data but along the way, I couldn’t shake the thought that excel could do more; I would ask myself: 

*"what if I could automate this entire process?"*

The idea intrigued me and I would start creating a tiny little feature, I didn’t know how to read or write code, I would simply ask google how to do it.

Then I would add another feature, quickly I had dynamic systems that automated 90% of the tasks involved using VBA (Visual Basic for Applications). So I guess I accidently learned VBA… God Bless Google! 

While the end result was stunningly functional and a tremendous time saver… I didn’t want it to be over. I accidently fell in love with the process of coding along the way. I found it to be the most enjoyable part of my job, which funnily, was not part of my job description, but what boss will complain that you automated several very time consuming tasks?

My passion for it stretched beyond work and become something I would think about all the time. What if I changed this or added that. Even while I slept, I dreamed in scenarios using booleans and loops. 

Then it happened, I asked myself: 

*“If I love this so much, why am I not pursuing this as my career?”*

The more I thought about it the more my heart became tied to the idea. It wasn't just a logical decision anymore.  But how do you begin something as  big as a career change? Well, I guess the same way my tea journey and coding journey began; yet another Google search…

So right then, I started on a journey with no end. 
Here’s to new starts, learning, and above all enjoying the process… most often with a cup of tea.
