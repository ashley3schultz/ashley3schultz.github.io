We've all seen those shirts or bumper stickers that say:

**"I would rather be ______________________" **

*fill in the statement with something you enjoy. *

Programming really is the thing that I would rather be doing and working as a software engineer is really just an excuse to get paid for what I am passionate about. I just feel lucky that I discovered a passion that pays.

I've heard people say, find your passion and figure out how to get paid for it. Well that's an inspiring meme but it doesn't always work out so well. I love tea but I haven't found anyone who will consistently pay me to drink it. Sure, I could come up with ideas. 

1. I could open a tea shop.. but isn't that's really just making money to pay for drinking tea.

2. I could become a tea blogger... but I would really be getting paid to write so I can pay to drink tea.

... and do I really enjoy writing blogs or running a business?

When I talk about what I want to do, people often provide feedback:

1. Your desire or dream isn't big enough
2. There's more money in management
3. You should start a business

The truth is, I've done all those and the most time consuming aspect of those things may not be the thing that I enjoy most. Is it wrong that my passion isn't what other people view as successful?  

I'm not opposed to any of those things; In fact, I've been a part of many startups and I'm good a wearing many hats and being the Wonder Women in the workplace. I've managed teams, written business plans, found new business funding, and spoken at seminars. I'm proud of being that person and working hard. I just don't want to become so busy doing everything around my passion that I don't have time for it.

We would all love to enjoy every aspect of what we do, but 100% enjoyment is pretty rare and probably not a realistic goal. It's pretty common that people like certain things about what they do and other things are not as enjoyable. 

I think it's ok if you don't love every aspect. The success I'm aiming for is reaching the point where the things that fill me outweigh the things that drain me; so there's perpetually more in my cup today than there was yesterday; and perhaps I know that programming is one of those things that fills my cup in a big way.

I remember when I was doing more public speaking and I felt like I was getting closer to a version of myself that I thought looked successful. but to be honest, it didn't fulfill me the way other things do. I think I was more in love with the image of public speaking than the actual event. 

About a year ago I stumbled on a song by Ben Howard titled "Oats In The Water". 

> Go your way,
> I'll take the long way 'round,
> I'll find my own way down,
> As I should
> 
> And hold your gaze,
> There's coke in the Midas touch,
> A joke in the way that we rust,
> And breathe again
> 
> And you'll find loss,
> And you'll fear what you found,
> When the weather comes,
> Tearing down
>  
> There'll be oats in the water,
> There'll be birds on the ground,
> There'll be things you never asked her,
> Oh how they tear at you now

The words resonated with me so loudly. It wasn't a fresh revelation but it puts words to what I had been feeling for such a long time. 

**No one else's journey of success needs to define mine. **

**I don't need permission to pursue the thing I want even if it's less in other peopleâ€™s eyes.**

**There is something really great and right about my journey and passions**

Something I realized about myself is that even though I'm really self-motivated and a natural leader, I actually really enjoy working for someone. I enjoy building things and I love being a part of a team and working together to build something.

For the first time I'm giving recognition to the small fact that there's not only nothing wrong with my desires but there is also a lot right with it.

In the words of Rami Malek: 

> I'm a fan of being exactly what I want to be
