<p>I enjoy life's process most of all. It's in the process that I see the map of where I've been and how I have arrived to this point in my journey. 
<br />I think the most beautiful aspect of process is its relativity to this moment. Who I choose to be or what I choose to do in this moment will map my journey ahead. Therefore, there is a ceaseless opportunity for growth, change and achievement.</p>
